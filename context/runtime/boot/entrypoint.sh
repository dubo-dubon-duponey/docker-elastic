# The virtual file /proc/self/cgroup should list the current cgroup
# membership. For each hierarchy, you can follow the cgroup path from
# this file to the cgroup filesystem (usually /sys/fs/cgroup/) and
# introspect the statistics for the cgroup for the given
# hierarchy. Alas, Docker breaks this by mounting the container
# statistics at the root while leaving the cgroup paths as the actual
# paths. Therefore, Elasticsearch provides a mechanism to override
# reading the cgroup path from /proc/self/cgroup and instead uses the
# cgroup path defined the JVM system property
# es.cgroups.hierarchy.override. Therefore, we set this value here so
# that cgroup statistics are available for the container this process
# will run in.
